HARSH
"My Daughter knows all the household chores. And her cooking, unglia chat te reh jayenge." I was sitting there staring at my cup of tea while Mr. Kanjilal was explaining how her daughter's cooking is so delicious, it will compel me to lick the skin right off my fingers. I like her. Okay, okay, she is beautiful and that is literary the only thing I know about this young girl who is going to be my wife. I don't even know her name properly. Was it Sulachana... Sulagna.... ? I hadn't even opened my shoes and my mom had already pulled me into the car forcing me to make this trip to her place. This is why I was dreading come home from Mumbai this time, because I knew my mom was going to do something like this.
